#summary MakeItSo command-line options

*`-file=[path-to-sln-file]`*

Example: `MakeItSo -file=e:\code\test\test.sln`

!MakeItSo will convert the solution file specified. The converted makefile will go into the solution's root folder, and not into the working directory that the command was issued from.

If the `-file` parameter is not passed on the command-line, !MakeItSo will look for a `.sln` file in the working folder.
