#summary What to do if you have a solution that cannot be converted by MakeItSo



(solution converter, not code converter)

(send simplified version of solution)

(not all solutions supported, e.g. .NET projects with v1)

(custom build steps, or pre- and post- build steps not yet supported)

(two types of problem: bug vs wishlist)
(do same for both)
