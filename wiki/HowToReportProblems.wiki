#summary What to do if you have a solution that cannot be converted by MakeItSo

===Before reporting a problem===
Before reporting a problem please note that:
  * !MakeItSo is just a solution to makefile converter. It does not convert your code itself. If your code has Windows specific features, you will need to make it more portable. !MakeItSo does not help with this.

  * Please check if the reason your project does not compile is already in the roadmap or in the Issues list. For example with version 1.0 these feature are not supported, but are in the future development plan: C# projects, custom build steps, VS2010 solutions.
