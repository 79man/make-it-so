#summary How to convert DLLs so that they will build as gcc .so libraries.

=== Overview ===
The code for shared-objects libraries in gcc is simpler than the code for Windows DLLs. For example, Windows has a DllMain() function and DLL_EXPORT declaration on functions. These are not needed for gcc. This page has a few notes on how to make DLLs so that they can be compiled on Windows and also port to gcc.

*DLL_EXPORT*

You need to undefine DLL_EXPORT for gcc builds. Include these lines before DLL_EXPORT is used. For example in header files that declare exported functions:
{{{
#ifdef WIN32
    #undef DLL_EXPORT
    #define DLL_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
    #undef DLL_EXPORT
    #define DLL_EXPORT 
#endif
}}}
